	in spring boot we got tomcat starter so we don't need to install tomcat or 
	need to link tomcat from external
	
	we have starter dep in pom.xml this starter contains n number of
	other dep. 
	
we dont have spring.xml or web.xml in spring boot. 
if we want to provide custom configuration we can use 
resources/application.properties

	key:value 
	key=value 
    format ,  we can use # for comment 
    
when we start app server/ioc container will read all the information from application.properties
